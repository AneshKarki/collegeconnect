          important dates in terms of education. The sole reason behind it was the establishment of

              As we all know, the establishment of an educational institution in the Rana Regime was mostly
              just on paper, and itâ€™s a bitter truth. In that era, in Bhaktapur, there was just one school named
              Bhaktapur English School and one Sanskrit Pathshala and Kanya Pathshala as the learning centers
              for education.
